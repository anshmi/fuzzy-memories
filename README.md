My very first repository! Stick around for my journey towards data analytics and the world of R!

I'm a student at the Indian Institute of Management, Indore (India) and have come across this beautiful field of analytics and statistics due to an internship which I had undertaken. This interest led me to try and learn more about the tools and methods used, hence I'm here, to try and learn something new and have fun in the process!
